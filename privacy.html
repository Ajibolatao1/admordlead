        <ul>
          <li>
            The following terms and conditions (this "Agreement") is a legal
            agreement between Admordlead ("Admordlead"), and PUBLISHER.
            PUBLISHER and Admordlead may also be individually referred to
            herein as a "Party" and collectively as "Parties." If there is any
            conflict between these Terms and Conditions and the Insertion
            Order(s), the Insertion Order(s) shall control.
          </li>
          <li>
            1.) Service: PUBLISHER will display the Advertisement and perform
            lead generation services described in the attached Insertion Order.
            "Advertisement" means the advertisement, including any copy
            including questions and or text ads, graphic, sound, video,
            programming code and/or other content that comprises the
            advertisement, as well as the websites to which an advertisement is
            linked if applicable. Admordlead hereby grants to PUBLISHER during
            the Contract Period a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right
            and license by all means and in any media, whether now known or
            hereafter discovered, to use, reproduce, distribute, publicly
            perform, publicly display and digitally perform such Advertisement
            and all its constituent parts.
          </li>
          <li>
            2.) Qualified Lead Definition (Qualified Leads): Qualified Leads are
            prospects who meet Admordlead’s screening criteria as described in
            the Insertion Order and who provide their complete contact data.
            PUBLISHER will be paid on a delivered per lead basis defined as when
            a user agrees through a pre approved opt-in method to be contacted.
            In the case of any dispute between the parties as to the number of
            Qualified Leads, Admordlead’s numbers will control.
          </li>
          <li>
            3.) Lead Validation Procedure: <br />
            Admordlead will verify each Qualified Lead delivered by the
            PUBLISHER. Upon receipt, all Qualified Leads will be checked for
            data validity (i.e. containing valid data inputs for the fields
            specified in the Insertion Order) and uniqueness of data (i.e. that
            the Qualified Leads are not present in Admordlead’s database for
            the designated Advertisement in the past 60 days). Admordlead
            reserves the right to send an auto-responder to all respondents
            re-confirming their request for information. Any objections from
            respondents (about the email, or the offer) will be raised to the
            PUBLISHER.
          </li>
          <li>
            4.) Creative Changes: Editing of Admordlead’s Creative is strictly
            prohibited, without prior written approval from Admordlead.
            Creative includes, but is not limited to, text ads, graphic ads,
            from and subject line, any copy associated with the campaign
            including survey questions and answers. Any changes to Creative,
            without prior written permission will result in the loss of payment
            of Leads.
          </li>
          <li>
            5.) Compliance: Admordlead will actively monitor PUBLISHER activity
            using a combination of its proprietary software and third party
            monitoring services. It is the obligation of PUBLISHER to prove to
            Admordlead that they are not committing fraud. Admordlead will
            hold PUBLISHER payment in ‘Pending Status’ until PUBLISHER has
            satisfactorily provided evidence that PUBLISHER is not defrauding
            the system. Admordlead flags accounts that: Have click-through
            rates that are much higher than industry averages and where solid
            justification is not evident; Have only click programs generating
            clicks with no indication by site traffic that it can sustain the
            clicks reported; Have shown fraudulent leads as determined by our
            clients or Use fake redirects, automated software, and/or fraud to
            generate clicks or leads. If PUBLISHER is unable to prove to
            Admordlead that PUBLISHER is not committing fraud, PUBLISHER will
            forfeit its entire commission for all programs and PUBLISHER’s
            account will be terminated. Admordlead reserves sole judgment in
            determining fraud.
          </li>
          <li>
            6.) Advertising Guidelines: PUBLISHER may, in its complete
            discretion, reject, cancel or remove at any time any Advertisement
            from the service for any reason without prior notice to Admordlead.
            PUBLISHER must notify Admordlead following the rejection,
            cancellation or removal of any Advertisement from the service within
            24 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            7.) Term &amp; Target Launch: Term will be one (1) month from the
            target launch of the initial campaign as noted in the Insertion
            Order. Agreement may continue thereafter by mutual consent but may
            be terminated by either party for any reason whatsoever. All
            legitimate moneys due to PUBLISHER will be paid during the next
            billing cycle. If PUBLISHER defrauds the system, then payment is
            revoked as determined solely by Admordlead.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.) Payment: PUBLISHER will invoice Admordlead on a monthly basis
            at the payout rates reflected in the Insertion Order. The invoice
            will reflect delivery of final Qualified Lead numbers that are based
            upon numbers reported by Admordlead to PUBLISHER pursuant to the
            terms of this Agreement. In the event Admordlead does not receive
            payment from ADVERTISER for any reason including, but not limited
            to, traffic provided by PUBLISHER, Admordlead shall have no
            obligation to make payment to PUBLISHER.
          </li>
          <li>
            9.) Payment Term: Admordlead shall make all payments to PUBLISHER
            within 30 days of the Invoice Date. All payments made to PUBLISHER
            do not include, and PUBLISHER shall pay, any sales, use or similar
            tax associated with such payment. All past due amounts shall accrue
            interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or
            the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is greater. Parties shall
            keep, maintain and preserve, for the term of this Agreement and for
            one (1) year thereafter, accurate records relating to amounts due
            hereunder (the “Relevant Records”). Either party shall have a right
            at least once per calendar year to audit the Relevant Records of the
            other party for the purpose of verifying fulfillment of party’s
            payment obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Each audit will be
            conducted at a place agreed to by the parties, during the normal
            business hours, with at least ten (10) business days prior written
            notice to party to be audited. Auditing party shall pay the fees and
            expenses of the audit, unless the audit reveals a payment
            discrepancy of more than ten percent (10%) of all payments due in
            any consecutive six (6) month period, in which case audited party
            shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the audit, and shall
            immediately pay to auditing party all amounts found to be due.
          </li>
          <li>

            13.) Confidentiality: The terms of this Agreement are confidential
            and shall not be disclosed to any third party except where required
            by law. All information submitted by end-user customers pursuant to
            this Agreement is proprietary to and owned by Admordlead. Such
            customer information is confidential and may not be disclosed by
            Admordlead or PUBLISHER. In addition, PUBLISHER acknowledges that
            all non-public information, data and reports received from
            Admordlead hereunder or as part of the services hereunder is

            Agreement for a period of five (5) years. This section does not bind
            Admordlead or PUBLISHER in the event such information is required
            to be disclosed by operation of law. If a request is made of
            PUBLISHER to disclose such information, PUBLISHER must immediately
            inform Admordlead via written notice sufficiently promptly to allow
            Admordlead to seek a Protective Order prior to the time commanded
            to produce or disclose such Confidential Information, and PUBLISHER
            agrees to cooperate in whatever way Admordlead requests to attempt
            to protect that information from disclosure by operation of law.
            Subject to prior approval by PUBLISHER, Admordlead may publicly
            announce its contractual relationship with PUBLISHER, which includes
            being on a listing of Admordlead publishers in general corporate
            materials and in industry standard press releases.

            INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY
            OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING
            FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE.
          </li>
          <li>
            15. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY: IN NO EVENT SHALL Admordlead BE
            LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
            DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT,
            WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), OR FOR INTERRUPTED
            COMMUNICATIONS, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS, LOST DATA OR LOST
            PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. UNDER
            NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL Admordlead BE LIABLE TO PUBLISHER OR ANY
            THIRD PARTIES FOR AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN THE AMOUNTS PAID BY
            Admordlead TO PUBLISHER DURING THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS.

          <li>
            16.) Indemnification: Each party agrees to indemnify, defend and
            hold harmless the other party and its employees, agents, officers
            and directors, against any and all claims, causes of actions,

            representation, or statement made in the Advertisement; (c) any
            breach of any representation or warranty contained in this
            Agreement.
          </li>
          <li>
            17. Dispute Resolution: If any dispute arises under this Agreement,
            the Parties agree to first try to resolve the dispute with the help
            of a mutually agreed upon mediator in the following location: State
            of Florida, Sarasota County. Any costs and fees other than
            attorneys’ fees associated with the mediation shall be shared
            equally by the parties. If it proves impossible to arrive at a

            to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in the following
            location: State of California, Los Angeles County. The Parties agree
            that the binding arbitration will be conducted under the rules of

            jurisdiction. If any litigation or arbitration is absolutely
            necessary to enforce this Agreement or the terms thereof, the
            prevailing Party shall be entitled to reimbursement by the other
            Party for reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses. This
            Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.
          </li>

            18. No Assignment: Neither Party shall have the right to assign or
            otherwise transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement
            except with the prior written consent of the other Party; provided,

            law, assignment, purchase or otherwise of all or substantially all
            the business of a Party may acquire its rights and obligations
            hereunder. Any prohibited assignment shall be null and void.

          <li>
            19. Independent Contractor: Each party is an independent contractor.
            Except as set forth in this Agreement, neither party is authorized
            or empowered to obligate the other or incur any costs on behalf of

          </li>
          <li>
            20. Severability: If any term, provision, covenant, or condition of
            this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
            invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the Agreement shall
            remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected or
            invalidated.
          </li>
          <li>
            21. Entire Agreement; Modification: This constitutes the entire
            agreement between the parties and supersedes any prior or
            inconsistent agreements, negotiations, representations and promises,

            course of conduct, amendment, supplement to or waiver of this
            Agreement or any provisions hereof shall be binding upon the parties
            unless made in writing and duly signed by both parties.
